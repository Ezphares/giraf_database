We describe the design and implmentation of a central server application for the GIRAF system with a database, an API for communication and synchronization between the central database and a local counterpart on an Android device. This is done in the context of a multiproject consisting of 8 groups, all working on various aspects of the GIRAF system. We end up with a working implementation and describe future work and tips for future students working on top of this project.
