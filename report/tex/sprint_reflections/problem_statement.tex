\section{Problem Statement}
The GIRAF system should seamlessly synchronize information across a large number of tablets.

Today the GIRAF system is able to store its information locally on a tablet. But each tablet needs to be customized to individual children's specific needs. However the children must not be dependent on a specific tablet. This means that some sort of synchronization is needed.

This requires a central database to be set up on a server, allowing the users to connect and update their local databases via the Internet. 

We will use a SCRUM development method to address this issue.
