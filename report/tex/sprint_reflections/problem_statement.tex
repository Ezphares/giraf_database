\section{Problem Statement}
The GIRAF system will seamlessly synchronize information across a large number of tablets.

Today the GIRAF system is able to store it's information locally on a tablet. But each tablet needs to be customized to individual children's specific needs. However the children must not be dependent on a specific tablet. This means that some sort of synchronization is needed. 

We will use a SCRUM development method to address this issue.

%A central database will lay the foundation for future work on the GIRAF project. Synchronization, for example, will need a robust foundation in form of an efficient and organized database before it can be built. The goal of this project is to make this central database.

%For this project, we want to:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Create a database that can be accessed over the Internet.
%\item Create a robust API that can be used to access the database.
%\item Create an application for synchronizing the central database with a local database on an Android device.
%\end{itemize}

%These problems will be solved with the use of MySQL for the database, JSON for the API, and a server will be set up using C++.

%As the database will create a base for future development on the GIRAF project, there is a need for well documented and reusable code, and a well documented API.

%The group will for this project aim to use an agile approach. We will employ Scrum, as well as other agile practices such as pair programming and continuous integration.
