\subsection{Morgana}
\label{sub:morgana:intro}
Development on the Morgana library started very late in the project, about a week before final code freeze.

Initially the goal of Morgana was to make it possible for all the \ac{giraf} applications to use both the Wasteland database (see \secref{sub:wasteland}) and the local Oasis database seamlessly, however this turned out to be a bigger project than was possible to finish in a week, so the focus was shifted to making it parse and write \ac{json} objects for use in calls to the Wasteland database.

The library implements a Java class for each value object documented in the Wasteland \ac{api}, each class parses a \ac{json} object and turns it into an object which can be used by \ac{giraf} applications, it is also able to create \ac{json} objects from the stored Java object.

Since the Wasteland database was not done for the final deadline of the code the Morgana library never made it into any of the \ac{giraf} applications of the 2013 semester, but extending the applications developed in the past with Morgana support should be as easy as writing the \ac{json} objects needed for the correct calls to the database.
