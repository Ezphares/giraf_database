\section{Problem Statement}
We want to create an efficient and organized database - we will serve clients with a user friendly and intuitive API for optimal database interaction.

Currently there is no central database. Such a database is important because the guardians of autistic children need access to the child's personal setting and pictograms regardless of what tablet is in use. Without the central database the multi-project will likely fail. At the very least it will severely inconvenience other project groups who rely on the database for completion of their projects.

There is a need for well documented, reusable code as there will be other project groups next year that will further develop the overall project.

The group will aim to use an agile approach to the project, and will employ Scrum and use other agile practices such as pair programming and continuous integration to achieve the goals of this problem statement.
