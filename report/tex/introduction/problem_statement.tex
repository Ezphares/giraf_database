\section{Problem Statement}
A central database will lay the foundation for future work on the GIRAF project. Synchronization, for example, will need a robust foundation in form of an efficient and organized database before it can be built. The goal of this project is to make this central database.

For this project, we want to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a database that can be accessed over the Internet.
\item Create a robust API that can be used to access the database.
\item Create an application for synchronizing the central database with a local database on an Android device.
\end{itemize}

These problems will be solved with the use of MySQl for the database, JSON for the API, and a server will be set up using C++.

As the database will create a base for future development on the GIRAF project, there is a need for well documented and reusable code, and a well documented API.

The group will for this project aim to use an agile approach. We will employ Scrum, as well as other agile practices such as pair programming and continuous integration.
