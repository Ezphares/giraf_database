\section{Builder Functions}
The so-called builder functions are implemented to facilitate ease of reading and writing in the API calls.

For all read calls to the API, some data from the database have to be altered to conform to the API standard either by renaming or fixing the type of the data. In order for this to happen, two functions are implemented,  \lstinline|fix_rename| and  \lstinline|fix_type|, which as their names imply rename and fix the type respectively.
