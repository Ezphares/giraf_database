\section{Overview}
The API and the server is comprised of several modules with various responsibilities, all running on the central server. They are listed and described here:

\begin{itemize}
\item Connection module: Responsible for receiving and maintaining a connection to the server. Also handles cleanup when the connection is closed. 
\item SQL wrapper module: This module handles the SQL functions needed to access the database, i.e. connect to the database, send a query, fetch a new row in a query result and of course escape a query to prevent SQL injections.
\item API call implementations module: Implementation of all calls available in the API and helper functions for these. 
\end{itemize}

Each module's implementation is described in the following sections.
