\section{Approach}
As described in \ac{cha:common}, a multi project of this nature requires a lot of structure and planning. In one of the first multi group meetings, all of the groups agreed on a development method, namely SCRUM. The development method used by the individual groups was up to them to decide. It was decided that all of the groups would meet on a weekly basis and discuss the progress of the individual groups and problems that might arise.  

\subsection{SCRUM implementation}
\label{sub:scrum_implementation}
For simplicity the group decided to use the same development method that was used on the multi-project level. There were however some alterations made to better suit the group's development style.

\subsubsection{Sprint Lengths}
Lectures during the semester meant that work was divided into half days. The group decided to use the sprint lengths agreed upon at the common meetings. 

\subsubsection{Pair Programming}
Pair Programming has been borrowed from the XP-development method as the group had positive experiences with the technique and found that it was well suited to the project.
