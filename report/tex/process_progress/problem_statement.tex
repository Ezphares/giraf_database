\section{Problem Statement}
The \ac{giraf} system should seamlessly synchronize information across a large number of tablets.

Today the \ac{giraf} system is able to store its information locally on a tablet. But each tablet needs to be customized to individual children's specific needs. However the children should not be dependent on a specific tablet. This means that some sort of synchronization is needed.

This requires a central database to be set up on a server, allowing the users to connect and update their local databases via the Internet. 

We will use a SCRUM development method in addressing this issue. We will develop a central server application to facilitate synchronization between tablets.
