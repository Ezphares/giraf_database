\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Known Bugs}
\begin{itemize}
\item On some update calls the server returns an OK, but no SQL is executed.
\item If a user can access several profiles there is no way to see which settings belong to which profile for any given application.
\item SQL errors can crash the server.
\item There is no way to make a user department administrator without directly accessing the database.
\item There are no SQL transactions in the \ac{api} which means race conditions are a risk. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Functionality}
\begin{itemize}
\item The buffer sizes should be increased to handle larger files.
\item Encryption and hashing should be added to the database and the connections.
\item It should be possible to create a copy of a pictogram if an update is made to one that has multiple links.
\item The public setting on pictograms should actually do something useful.
\item The synchronization should be updated to have support for selective download from the database.
\item A library for Android applications should be made to allow them to access the local database.
\item The local database should not be allowed to exceed a certain size.
\item Synchronization should be automatic instead of manual.
\item A thread pool should be implemented to prevent thread overflow on the central server.
\item Database information should not be hardcoded.
\item Sessions should be implemented.
\end{itemize}
