\section{Project Status}

Currently, the \ac{api} is implemented and tested with basic functionality and there is a central database containing all information needed to the best of our knowledge. There is a local database, however it is not accessible by applications at this moment. There is basic two-way synchronization between the central database and the local database. Everything is currently unencrypted. There are still some bugs in the code which need to be fixed.
